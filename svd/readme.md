### DBSCAN
A density-based clustering non-parametric algorithm that groups together data points that are closely packed together, marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions

### K-Means
A method of vector quantization that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster
### K-Means++
An algorithm for choosing the initial values or ‘seeds’ for the k-means clustering algorithm

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
The process of computing principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
The factorization of a real or complex matrix
